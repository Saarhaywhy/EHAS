           <article>
                <p>Everybody has a story (EHAS) is a non-governmental organization that aims at helping
            others share their experience from their true life stories. Experiences which many may have
            harbored for years. Experiences which will make people learn and not make mistake while
            dealing with similar issues later in life.
                EHAS was birthed due to;
                <ul>
                    <li>The secret cries of others.</li>
                    <li>The burden of people wanting to help others not to fall victims of same
                    mistake(s) they made.</li>
                    <li>The regret(s) many had and want to share but are unable to share
                    (stigmatization)</li>
                    <li>The need to have a stable mental health, which is part of the SDG goal (SDG 3.4 –
                    Promoting mental health)</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2 style="font-family: monospace;"> OUR VISION </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> To relieve the burdens in others </li>
                <li> To put smile on others face </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 style="font-family: monospace;"> OUR MISSION </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> To give voice to those who are hurt </li>
                <li> To create a sustainable platform where people learn and know that beyond what happens, there is hope.</li>
                <li> To make people not to make mistake as they learn from people’s experience </li>
                <li>To ease mental stress/disturbance off others </li>
                <li> To give hope to others </li>
            </ul>
             
       

           <h2 style="font-family: monospace;"> OUR CORE VALUE </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> <b> Believe: </b> We believe everyone has gone through somethings that made them who they are. And thus, we believe they can be a better person.</li>
                <li> <b> Integrity: </b>We all at EHAS are determined to be true to the course which we are called for - "To relieve others burden" </li>
                <li> <b> Support: </b> To support impactors in having a good mental health </li> 
            </ul>
